I'm a frontend software engineer with a focus on architecture and performance. My goal is to create scalable and efficient systems that deliver the best user experience. I'm an avid user of nvim and a coffee lover. When I need a break from coding, I enjoy staying active and spending time outdoors :mountain:

I'm always eager to learn and stay updated on the latest trends in frontend development.
